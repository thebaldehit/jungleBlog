        text: 'This group of 27 men were supposed to find a possible route to build the Panama canal, and set off into the jungle with the hopes of discovering a pathway for it. The group knew they would be in the trees for potentially several weeks, but for some unknown reason they only brought enough food to last them for 10 days.\n' +
            'It goes without saying that if you walk for 10 days into a jungle before you run out of food then you’re in trouble. The group started to break apart and some turned back, while others pressed forward. Members of the group began to drop one by one until only a handful were left. After starvation, disease and accidents only a fraction of the original 27 survived.',

She ate what they ate and drank from the same waters until eventually, the monkeys began to trust her and took her in as their own. She lived for several years with the monkeys and learnt how to survive as one of them.',

She had to survive for 16 days with nothing more than she could find, and after walking through the thick vegetation she also had her clothes ripped to pieces and had to survive most of her ordeal naked.',
